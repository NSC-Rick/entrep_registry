# NEK Registry Portal

A minimal Streamlit prototype for a regional registry portal, designed to provide simple, readable pages that can be deployed quickly and iterated on with stakeholders.

## MVP scope

This MVP is intentionally lightweight and includes only:
- A Streamlit app entry point with basic navigation
- An initiatives page that demonstrates a simple registry table using in-memory sample data
- A placeholder page for a future downtown business registry

## Intentionally excluded

To keep the prototype focused and easy to deploy, it does not include:
- Authentication or user accounts
- A database or persistent storage
- External APIs, integrations, or background jobs

## Deployment

This project is designed for Streamlit Cloud deployment.

Run locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
